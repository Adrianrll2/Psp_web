        <h1>Where does Frutiger Aero originate from?</h1>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">
            Frutiger Aero is a visual aesthetic that emerged during the mid-2000s to early 2010s. It's mostly associated with the look of operating systems like Windows Vista and Windows 7, as well as tech advertising and UI design from that era.

            1. The Name: "Frutiger Aero"
        </p>
        <p>
            The term Frutiger Aero is a retroactive label created by online communities (like Tumblr, Reddit, and YouTube) to describe a nostalgic aesthetic. It comes from:

            Frutiger – a widely used sans-serif typeface in corporate and tech branding during the 2000s.
        </p>

        <p>
            Aero – the name of the graphical interface used in Windows Vista and Windows 7, known for its glossy, glass-like design with transparency and smooth effects.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Frutiger Aero" was never an official design style — it's a modern way to describe the common visual elements of that time.

        <p>
            Yep, this style is a mixture of other different styles and mostly transparency which creates a glass effect. <img src="eulq7T8.png" />
